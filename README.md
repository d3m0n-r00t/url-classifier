# Url-Classifier using Machine Learning
The ML tool classifies url based on the url's parameters.
The tool provides 92% success rates with just 3 input parameters from the url.
The input parameters are the url's:
    1. Method 
    2. Domain
    3. Path
We can improve accuracy after gathering more parameters.

## Usage
```bash
python3 logistic_regression_classifier.py
```

NOTE: Make sure the data.csv is in the same folder as the tool.
